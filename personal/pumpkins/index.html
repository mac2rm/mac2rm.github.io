		<p>10/25/13. This was the first pumpkin I carved at UVA. I entered it in a contest in the "Scary" category. 2nd place!</p>

		<p>10/29/13. Probably the best pumpkin I carved this year. Inspired by a tattoo on the face of a rapper in a picture in a plastic bag that was duct-taped to the door of my suite. Yeah...</p>

		<p>10/30/13. Originally I intended to carve this pumpkin for a school-wide contest, but I didn't like how it turned out. It's a little spooky, but not my best work.</p>

		<p>10/30/13. This is the one I submitted to the contest. It took me about three and a half hours to do, all in. I did the whole thing with a pocketknife, since there was no carving that needed to be done, only shaving.</p>
