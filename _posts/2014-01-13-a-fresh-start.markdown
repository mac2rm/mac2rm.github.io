title: A Fresh Start
---

Today was the first day of my second semester of college classes. It was a much needed fresh start. I had a rough 
first semester at UVA. Not in the sense that I struggled with classes or couldn't figure out laundry or was homesick 
all the time. Rather, I had a rough semester because I wasn't happy. There is a LOT of drinking and partying at the 
University of Virginia. There is also a fair amount of pot smoking, class skipping, and rule breaking in general. 
I'm really not into any of that. I struggled with the idea that there are people here, at the best university in 
Virginia, whose primary activities are being or becoming intoxicated. It just didn't seem possible. Surely they do 
SOMETHING else. Anything. Please?

I didn't have fun last semester, and that's what really bothered me. I didn't do much with friends, I didn't have a 
social club or gathering to meet new people, I was alone. I felt extremely isolated. It was lonely, to say the very 
least. On top of that, I was bored out of my mind. I enrolled in 15 credits, which is average, but they were not very 
high-level classes. I had an intro Commerce course that was a gigantic list of business vocabulary and a ton of busy 
work. I had an intro Economics course with the renowned Ken Elzinga, and I enjoyed that class a lot, but it didn't 
give any homework and didn't keep me busy. My multivariable calculus course was interesting but fairly laid-back and 
entirely conceptual, so I spent more time helping my Calc I and Calc II friends with their homework than I spent doing my 
own math homework. After five years of Spanish, I began a new language with a level-one Portuguese course. That class was 
fantastic, but I didn't do any homework until the day before the test, so even the intro language course didn't keep me 
busy. My fifth course was a one-credit seminar on the history of UVA, and for a while it was my most difficult course. 
In short, I had more time on my hands than I knew what to do with.

So this semester is a chance for change.

I am taking more courses and more credits, I'm making an active effort to meet with friends and go to the gym and do 
fun things. I am also looking to start my own club, a Spanish-language conversation forum called Gringo Group. Details 
to follow. More than anything, however, I am looking for a change of attitude. I can't let anyone else's choices bother me. 
This is my college experience too, and I'm going to make to the most of it. This is my time to be happy.
